The room is akin to a psych ward, no windows and a large wooden door that is locked from the outside.  The player must solve the room's riddles and clues to escape. 
The escape is a vent underneath the desk that Annie used countless times to write letters to her family asking them to help her get out of the Asylum. However, 
unbeknownst to Annie, her favorite Teddy bear named Scratcher is actually a demon that is trapped within the bear. 

Scratcher occasionally talks to Annie, and more importantly he gives her the ability to manipulate fire. One night, Annie's parents were having a heated argument,
and things got physical. Annie became enraged and in doing so she burned down the entire home, with her mother, father, and brother in it. Everyone perished except Annie of course.

So, the clues to escape the room lie in discovering this story through key elements like charred marks on the walls, letters in the desk and on top of the desk. 
Tiny claw marks riddled throughout the '
room, namely on the floor and bed.
